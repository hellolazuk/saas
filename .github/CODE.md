# Coding Requirement Document

## Application Width
- Ensure the application width is a maximum of **1280px**.
- Use a **responsive layout** to adapt the design for various screen sizes.
- Implement **properly organized routing** to ensure seamless navigation across all pages.

## Language and Font
- Create the entire application in **Bengali language**.
- Use the **Hind Siliguri** font from Google Fonts for all textual content to maintain a consistent look and feel.

## Mobile-First Design
- **Design for mobile devices first**, then scale up for larger screens.
- Use **touch-friendly interface elements**, ensuring easy interaction on smaller screens.
- Implement gestures such as:
  - **Swipe** for navigation or dismissal of elements.
  - **Pinch-to-zoom** for image or content interaction.
- Consider **thumb zones** for important interactive elements to enhance usability.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Set up the base layout:**
   - Restrict the maximum width of the app to **1280px** using a CSS container.
   - Ensure the layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

2. **Configure Google Fonts:**
   - Import the **Hind Siliguri** font into the project.
   - Apply the font to the entire application via global CSS or theme.

3. **Mobile-First Development:**
   - Start designing for mobile screens with a focus on essential elements.
   - Add media queries to progressively scale the design for larger devices.

4. **Routing Setup:**
   - Organize routes logically, ensuring consistency and proper linking across pages.
   - Test navigation across all pages to confirm proper routing before finalizing.
   - Think and check the rendering issue and fix it.

5. **Touch-Friendly Design:**
   - Use larger, well-spaced buttons and inputs for easy touch interaction.
   - Integrate gestures (e.g., swipe, pinch-to-zoom) using suitable libraries or native JavaScript features.

6. **Review and Test:**
   - Verify that the maximum width, language, and font are consistently applied.
   - Check the routing functionality for all pages.
   - Test the mobile-first design on multiple devices to ensure proper responsiveness and usability.

## Final Checks
- Ensure routing between pages is fully functional.
- Verify that all text is displayed in **Bengali** with the **Hind Siliguri** font.
- Confirm that the design is touch-friendly and optimized for both mobile and desktop devices.
